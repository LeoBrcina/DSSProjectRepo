# 📘 Decision Support System – DSSProjectRepo  
### *(SPO – Sustavi potpore odlučivanju / DSS – Decision Support Systems)*

This repository contains a complete Decision Support System (DSS) project created for the **SPO (Sustavi potpore odlučivanju)** course.  
The project demonstrates how analytical models, data preprocessing, and visualization support real decision-making processes.

The primary dataset used in this project is **`day.csv`**, and all analysis is implemented in the **Jupyter Notebook (`Project.ipynb`)**.

## 🎯 Objectives of the Project

This SPO/DSS project focuses on:

- Understanding and preparing a real dataset for analysis  
- Applying statistical and analytical techniques  
- Creating visualizations that support decision-making  
- Building simple predictive or descriptive models  
- Interpreting results and extracting actionable insights  

---

## 📊 Dataset Description – `day.csv`

The **`day.csv`** dataset contains daily aggregated data commonly used in decision-support analysis.  
It includes variables such as:

- Date and seasonal information  
- Weather conditions  
- Temperature, humidity, wind  
- Count metrics useful for forecasting or trend analysis  

This makes the dataset suitable for:

- Time series trend detection  
- Weather impact analysis  
- Correlation analysis  
- Basic forecasting and DSS modeling

## 🧪 Techniques Implemented in `Project.ipynb`

The notebook demonstrates a full DSS workflow:

### ✔ Data loading and cleaning  
Handling missing values, converting types, preparing data.

### ✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
Descriptive statistics, correlation matrices, distribution plots.

### ✔ Visualization  
Visual charts supporting decision-making (seasonal trends, weather influence, etc.).

### ✔ Modeling  
Simple predictive or descriptive models (e.g., regression, correlation-based models, basic ML methods if required by the assignment).

### ✔ Insight generation  
Clear interpretation of results relevant for decision-makers.
